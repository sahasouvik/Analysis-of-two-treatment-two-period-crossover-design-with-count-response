Mixing Parameter-
Beta is the mixing parameter which helps in measuring the carryover effect i.e it helps in measuring the effect of first period over the second period.
If beta=0 then the second period becomes independent of the first period.Since it is a croosover design and the effect of the first period is carried over to the second so the value of beta cannot be 0.

Remarks:-
1)The power of  T1 decreases monotonically with the increase in beta.
2)The power of T3 shows no change or increases very little with increase in beta.
3)T2 is consistent and its power increases consistently with increase in beta.
4)T2 performs best with change in beta followed by T1 and T3.
